                            <p>P. Rajagopal opened a tiny grocery shop on the outskirts of the city.[3] In 1992, Rajagopal on his visits to Singapore observed the functioning of the multinational fast food joints like McDonald's and used them as a model.[4]

                                By the 1990s, the Saravana Bhavan chain spread throughout neighbourhoods in Chennai. In 2000, Saravana Bhavan opened its first branch outside India, in Dubai, with a large number of Indian expatriates. It eventually expanded to several major cities including Paris, Frankfurt, London, New York City, Dallas, Toronto, Stockholm, Doha, and Auckland. While the restaurants have gained popularity among non-Indians, they mostly target the South Asian expatriate population. They are sometimes referred to as "canteen-like joints strictly aimed at Indian expatriates missing a taste of home".[5] It is considered to be a high volume, low margin venture which is labour-intensive. Saravana Bhavan sends workers from India and America to work in their foreign branches.[6] The overseas outlets are run by franchisees.[7]</p>
